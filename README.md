# B7burger Project

## Overview

Welcome to the B7burger project! This project is part of a practice exercise focused on HTML and CSS concepts. It was created as a learning exercise based on the teachings of Bonieky, offered in the last module of one of his courses on b7web.com.

The purpose of the B7burger project is to apply and reinforce HTML and CSS concepts such as:

- Structuring web pages using HTML tags
- Styling elements with CSS properties and selectors
- Creating responsive designs for different screen sizes
